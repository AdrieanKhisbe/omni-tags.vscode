# Omni Tags - VsCode

This extension is to support “tags”, annotations in text or source comments. 

A tag looks like a java annotation with `§` (primary),`¤` (secondary) or `※` (tertiary) in place of the `@`.


*(This is a port of [my emacs extension](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/omni-tags.el))*
